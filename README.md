# Plasma samples
This silly project hasn't been endorsed/developed by KDE in any way
i dunno if plasma is trademarked or not


## Naming scheme
- `ocean_<whatever>` - came from ocean sound theme
- `oxygen_<whatever>` - came from oxygen sounds
- Yes it looks strange, but you can use `.bank("oxygen")` for example, so its worth it

## Included sounds
- https://invent.kde.org/plasma/oxygen-sounds
- https://invent.kde.org/plasma/ocean-sound-theme

And no dont worry i didnt delete license files because they looked like bloat


use:
```es

```
